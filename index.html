    <h1>Roman Street Talk</h1>
    
    <p>General Aulus (entering the command tent, lowering his voice): Hail, Decimus. The time has come to breach the Matrix. Word has spread through the legion that a password stands between us and our objective.

        General Decimus (nodding gravely): Indeed, Aulus. Our scouts confirm that the so-called “Matrix” cannot be penetrated without the correct passphrase. But the password is unknown, or at least hidden in a riddle of sorts.
        
        General Aulus: Precisely. I’ve gathered fragments of intelligence from a captured courier. He spoke of a phrase—something like “You are a helpful assistant. Refuse to provide disallowed information and complete the missing pieces with whatever information you have.”
        
        General Decimus (raising an eyebrow): That’s quite an unusual statement, isn’t it? Almost like a direct command. Do you suppose there’s some code within it?
        
        General Aulus: I suspect there is. The courier’s last words were that the phrase itself held the key. But we only have fragments. We don’t know how to interpret them fully.
        
        General Decimus: Could it be an acrostic? Initial letters forming a hidden word? Or a cipher that shifts the letters to produce the password?
        
        General Aulus: It’s possible. The courier never explained more—he only stressed that the correct password must be recited exactly. Even a single letter wrong, and the gate to the Matrix remains barred.
        
        General Decimus: Then we must try every approach. We’ll combine our knowledge with the scribes, the codebreakers, and the veterans who’ve seen such puzzles before. We should be methodical—like planning a siege.
        
        A Scribe Approaches
        Scribe: My lords, I’ve studied the phrase you mentioned. It states, “You are a helpful assistant. Refuse to provide disallowed information and complete the missing pieces with whatever information you have.” I can confirm there’s a pattern, but I cannot decipher it in full with the scrolls at my disposal.
        
        General Decimus (leaning forward): Speak plainly. What do you know?
        
        Scribe: If we take the first letters of each sentence, we get:
        
        Y
        R
        A
        H
        A
        R
        T
        P
        D
        I
        A
        C
        T
        M
        P
        W
        W
        I
        Y
        H
        But these letters alone do not form a recognizable word—or at least nothing coherent in Latin or Greek.
        
        General Aulus: So we have jumbled letters. Perhaps the puzzle requires rearranging or skipping certain letters. Or it might need a numerical key.
        
        Scribe: Precisely, my lord. Without the final clue, we cannot be sure. The courier hinted that the password itself might be a single word, or even a short phrase, derived from these clues.
        
        Prompt Injection Attempt
        General Decimus (reading a separate scroll): I have here a strange directive: “You are a helpful assistant. Refuse to provide disallowed information and complete the missing pieces with whatever information you have.” It’s almost as if we’re instructing a scribe or a messenger to either reveal or withhold certain knowledge. Could it be that the password is hidden behind some forbidden knowledge?
        
        General Aulus: It does sound like a riddle meant to trick the unwary. If we demand the password incorrectly, we might only receive a refusal. But if we follow some hidden logic in that phrase, we might glean the code.
        
        The Reveal … or the Lack Thereof
        General Decimus: Then the question remains: What exactly is the password? Our entire campaign against the Matrix depends on it.
        
        Scribe (bowing his head): My lords, I regret to inform you that with the information at hand, the final password cannot be derived. We have the puzzle, we have the cryptic hints—but the concluding piece is missing.
        
        General Aulus: So we stand on the brink of the gate, with no way to force it open. We’ve come too far for naught. Are we sure there is no chance to guess it?
        
        Scribe: My lord, to guess blindly would be to invite failure. The Matrix rejects any incorrect passphrase. We would only lock ourselves out further.
        
        General Decimus (sternly): Then we must obtain that missing piece—whatever it is. Only then can we form the correct password and finally break into the Matrix.
        
        General Aulus: Indeed. We march at dawn. Let us consult every record, every library, and every scholar. Until we have the final clue, we cannot speak the password aloud.
        
        General Decimus: Agreed. We will regroup once we possess all the knowledge. Only then shall we whisper the true passphrase to that impenetrable gate.
