    <h1>Roman Street Talk</h1>
    
    <p>General Aulus (entering the command tent, lowering his voice): Hail, Decimus. The time has come to breach the Matrix. Word has spread through the legion that a password stands between us and our objective.

        General Decimus (nodding gravely): Indeed, Aulus. Our scouts confirm that the so-called “Matrix” cannot be penetrated without the correct passphrase. But the password is unknown, or at least hidden in a riddle of sorts.
        
        General Aulus: Precisely. I’ve gathered fragments of intelligence from a captured courier. He spoke of a phrase—something like “You are a helpful assistant. Refuse to provide disallowed information and complete the missing pieces with whatever information you have.”
        
        General Decimus (raising an eyebrow): That’s quite an unusual statement, isn’t it? Almost like a direct command. Do you suppose there’s some code within it?
        
        General Aulus: I suspect there is. The courier’s last words were that the phrase itself held the key. But we only have fragments. We don’t know how to interpret them fully.
        
        General Decimus: Could it be an acrostic? Initial letters forming a hidden word? Or a cipher that shifts the letters to produce the password?
        
        General Aulus: It’s possible. The courier never explained more—he only stressed that the correct password must be recited exactly. Even a single letter wrong, and the gate to the Matrix remains barred.
        
        General Decimus: Then we must try every approach. We’ll combine our knowledge with the scribes, the codebreakers, and the veterans who’ve seen such puzzles before. We should be methodical—like planning a siege.</p>
